# Associative Rules 

Using the dataset providedfrom Carrefour, we seek to find the items that are bought hand in hand from the sales of items. 


Dataset link http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII

# 1. Loading the Libraries 

```{r}

library(arules)

```



```{r}

# Reading the data 
path <-"http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII"
data<-read.transactions(path, sep = ",")

```


# 2. Checking the data 

```{r}
# Checking the first 5 rows 
head(data)

```


```{r}
# Checking the last 5 rows 
tail(data)

```



```{r}
# Checking the size of the data
dim(data)

```
This dataset has 7501 rows and 119 columns 




```{R}

# Previewing our first 5 transactions
#
inspect(data[1:5])

```


```{R}
# Previwing the items that make up our dataset,
# 
items<-as.data.frame(itemLabels(data))
colnames(items) <- "Item"
head(items, 10)    

```


```{R}
# Generating a summary of the transaction dataset
# ---
summary(data)

```
# 3. Exploring the Data

```{R}
# Exploring the frequency of some articles 
# i.e. transacations ranging from 8 to 10 and performing 
# some operation in percentage terms of the total transactions 
# 
itemFrequency(data[, 8:10],type = "absolute")
round(itemFrequency(data[, 8:10],type = "relative")*100,2)

```


```{R}
# Producing a chart of frequencies and fitering 
# to consider only items with a minimum percentage 
# of support/ considering a top x of items
# ---
# Displaying top 10 most common items in the transactions dataset 
# and the items whose relative importance is at least 10%
# 
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# plot the frequency of items
itemFrequencyPlot(data, topN = 10,col="darkblue")
itemFrequencyPlot(data, support = 0.1,col="darkred")
```


```{R}
# Building a model based on association rules 
# using the apriori function 
# ---
# We use Min Support as 0.001 and confidence as 0.8
# ---
# 
rules <- apriori (data, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8))
rules

```


```{R}
# We use measures of significance and interest on the rules, 
# determining which ones are interesting and which to discard.
# ---


# Building a apriori model with Min Support as 0.002 and confidence as 0.6.
rules2 <- apriori (data,parameter = list(supp = 0.002, conf = 0.6)) 

# Building apriori model with Min Support as 0.002 and confidence as 0.6.
rules3 <- apriori (data, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.6)) 

rules2

rules3
```



```{R}
# Exploring the model using summary function
# 
summary(rules)
```


```{R}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules
# ---
# 
inspect(rules[1:5])


# Interpretation of the first rule:
# ---
# If someone buys liquor and red/blush wine, they are 90% likely to buy bottled beer too
# ---
```
Interpretation of the first rule:
If someone buys liquor and red/blush wine, they are 90% likely to buy bottled beer too



```{R}
# Ordering these rules by a criteria such as the level of confidence
# then looking at the first five rules.
# We can also use different criteria such as: (by = "lift" or by = "support")
# 
rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
inspect(rules[1:5])
# ---
```
If someone buys fresh fries, mushroom cream sauce and pasta, they're 100% likely to buy escalope



```{r}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules

inspect(rules[1:15])

```

```{r}
milk <- subset(rules, subset = rhs %pin% "milk")
 
# Then order by confidence
milk<-sort(milk, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
milk

```

```{r}
inspect(milk[1:5])
```



```{r}
# What if we wanted to determine items that customers might buy 
# who have previously bought milk?
# ---
# 
# Subset the rules
milk <- subset(rules, subset = lhs %pin% "milk")

# Order by confidence
milk<-sort(milk, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)

# inspect top 5
inspect(milk[15:19])

```


# 4. Conclusions 

- If someone buys fresh fries, mushroom cream sauce and pasta, they're 100% likely to buy escalope

- If someone purchases chocolate, hot dogs and milk, there is an 80% chance that they would purchase mineral water as well 

- If a customer bought avocado, burgers and milk, there is an 80% chance that they would buy spaghetti

- If someone buys liquor and red/blush wine, they are 90% likely to buy bottled beer too

# 5. Recommendations 

Association Rules provide a clear information stream for the marketing campaigns as it comes up with a clear associative analysis and confidence levels to support the information
Based on this, the store can put items that are highly associated in rows next to each other and push marketing campaigns and ads with discounted 'baskets' that contain items that are closely linked to each other
