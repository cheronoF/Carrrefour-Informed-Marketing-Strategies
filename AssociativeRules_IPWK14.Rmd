```{r}
# Checking the last 5 rows

```



```{r}
# Checking the size of the data

```
This dataset has 7501 rows and 119 columns 

```{R}

# Previewing our first 5 transactions
#
inspect(data[1:5])

```


```{R}
# Previwing the items that make up our dataset,
# 
items<-as.data.frame(itemLabels(data))
colnames(items) <- "Item"
head(items, 10)    
```


```{R}
# Generating a summary of the transaction dataset
# ---
summary(data)

```


```{R}
# Exploring the frequency of some articles 
# i.e. transacations ranging from 8 to 10 and performing 
# some operation in percentage terms of the total transactions 
# 
itemFrequency(data[, 8:10],type = "absolute")
round(itemFrequency(data[, 8:10],type = "relative")*100,2)

```


```{R}
# Producing a chart of frequencies and fitering 
# to consider only items with a minimum percentage 
# of support/ considering a top x of items
# ---
# Displaying top 10 most common items in the transactions dataset 
# and the items whose relative importance is at least 10%
# 
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# plot the frequency of items
itemFrequencyPlot(data, topN = 10,col="darkblue")
itemFrequencyPlot(data, support = 0.1,col="darkred")
```


```{R}
# Building a model based on association rules 
# using the apriori function 
# ---
# We use Min Support as 0.001 and confidence as 0.8
# ---
# 
rules <- apriori (data, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8))
rules

```


```{R}
# We use measures of significance and interest on the rules, 
# determining which ones are interesting and which to discard.
# ---


# Building a apriori model with Min Support as 0.002 and confidence as 0.6.
rules2 <- apriori (data,parameter = list(supp = 0.002, conf = 0.6))

```



```{R}
# We can perform an exploration of our model 
# through the use of the summary function as shown
# ---
# Upon running the code, the function would give us information about the model 
# i.e. the size of rules, depending on the items that contain these rules. 
# In our above case, most rules have 3 and 4 items though some rules do have upto 6. 
# More statistical information such as support, lift and confidence is also provided.
# ---
# 
summary(rules)
```


```{R}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules
# ---
# 
inspect(rules[1:5])


# Interpretation of the first rule:
# ---
# If someone buys liquor and red/blush wine, they are 90% likely to buy bottled beer too
# ---
```


```{R}
# Ordering these rules by a criteria such as the level of confidence
# then looking at the first five rules.
# We can also use different criteria such as: (by = "lift" or by = "support")
# 
rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
inspect(rules[1:5])
# ---
```
If someone buys fresh fries, mushroom cream sauce and pasta, they're 100% likely to buy escalope


```{r}
summary(rules)

```

```{r}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules
inspect(rules[1:15])

```

```{r}
milk <- subset(rules, subset = rhs %pin% "milk")
 
# Then order by confidence
milk<-sort(milk, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
milk

```

```{r}
inspect(milk[1:5])
```



```{r}
# What if we wanted to determine items that customers might buy 
# who have previously bought milk?
# ---
# 
# Subset the rules
milk <- subset(rules, subset = lhs %pin% "milk")

# Order by confidence
milk<-sort(milk, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)

# inspect top 5
inspect(milk[15:19])

```

If someone purchases chocolate, hot dogs and milk, there is an 80% chance that they would purchase mineral water as well 
If a customer bought avocado, burgers and milk, there is an 80% chance that they would buy spaghetti. 

Conclusion. 

Association Rules provide a clear information stream for the marketing campaigns as it comes up with a clear associative analysis and confidence levels to support the information.
